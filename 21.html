<!-- What are the looping structures in JavaScript? Any one Example?

JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:

for - loops through a block of code a number of times
for/in - loops through the properties of an object
for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object
while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true

a) For loop:

syntex:

for (expression 1; expression 2; expression 3) {
    // code block to be executed
  }

  Expression 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.

Expression 2 defines the condition for executing the code block.

Expression 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed. -->
